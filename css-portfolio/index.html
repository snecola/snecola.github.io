          <h2>Software Engineer</h2>

          <p>I'm a computer science student at Queens College passionate about furthering my career in Software Engineering. Currently I lead and organize an eSports community of over 300 people passionate about individual and team improvement. Doing so has been a monumental exercise in software development, scheduling consistency, and team organization. Every day I acquire new tools and work on new projects to raise the standard of work I can accomplish.</p>

              <p>Founder and leader of an online eSports community playing Planetside 2 with over 300 active members focused on constant personal and team improvement. As such, infrastructure and organization of this project has been a massive and very constructive learning experience. Some of my accomplishments towards bettering the community include:
              <ul><li>Use of JavaScript, Advanced Excel, and Google APIs to automate tedious document creation through a single short and easy Google form. This has saved about an hour of manual labor from trainee initialization time across 100+ new members since implemented.</li>
              <li>Many scripts created, modified, and maintained using Python, JavaScript, and REST APIs to display team member statistics and growth trends in a clear and concise manner. This has led to a calculated 80% retention rate for players.</li>
              <li>Tutoring and learning new tools from the wide variety of Computer Science students and software engineers in the community to continue pursuing my career as a Software Engineer.</li>
